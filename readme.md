<h3>Industrial Design: 2D / 3D Fabrication</h3>

<p>Industrial design is a process of design applied to physical products that are to be manufactured by mass production. It is the creative act of determining and defining a productâ€™s form and features, which takes place in advance of the manufacture or production of the product. 

In this course we will be using 3D printers and Laser Cutters to design and build Models, Figurines, App UI, Appliances, Furniture, and much more. This is an excellent class for students interested in learning how to ideate and build in the classical forms of Architecture and Design, using software and contemporary building tools.

We will make and design using the Makerbot Printer and TinkerCAD programs. Children with experience in these frameworks will discover new challenges and ideas in these classes. 

This class is also great for beginners.

By the end of each semester, students will have a portfolio of their designs, and the inspiration to make more.</p>
